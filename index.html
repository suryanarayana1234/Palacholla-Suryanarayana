    <h3>Achivements</h3>
    <p>
      Rohit Sharma has achieved numerous milestones throughout his illustrious
      cricket career, establishing himself as one of the greatest modern batsmen
      in the world. He is the only player in cricket history to score three
      double centuries in One Day Internationals (ODIs), with his highest being
      a record-breaking 264 runs against Sri Lanka in 2014 — the highest
      individual score ever in ODIs. In the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, he set
      another record by scoring five centuries in a single tournament, the most
      by any player. As captain, Rohit led India to victory in the 2024 ICC T20
      World Cup and was also a part of India’s triumphant squads in the 2007 T20
      World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Beyond international cricket,
      Rohit has been an exceptional leader in the Indian Premier League (IPL),
      guiding the Mumbai Indians to five championship titles under his
      captaincy. Known for his elegant stroke play and calm demeanor, he has hit
      the most sixes by an Indian batsman in international cricket and has
      scored centuries in all three formats of the game. His outstanding
      performances earned him several honors, including the prestigious Rajiv
      Gandhi Khel Ratna Award in 2020 and the ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year
      award in 2019. With over 18,000 international runs to his name, Rohit
      Sharma continues to be a symbol of consistency, leadership, and excellence
      in world cricket.

    <h3>Who is Rohit Sharma</h3>
    <pr>
      Rohit Gurunath Sharma, born on April 30, 1987, in Bansod, Nagpur,
      Maharashtra, is one of India’s most accomplished cricketers and captains.
      He began his cricket journey under coach Dinesh Lad and made his mark in
      domestic cricket playing for Mumbai. His consistent performances earned
      him a spot in the Indian team, and he made his ODI debut in 2007 against
      Ireland, followed by his T20I debut the same year. Initially, Rohit’s
      career saw ups and downs due to inconsistency, but his fortunes changed
      when he was promoted to open the batting in 2013. Since then, he has
      become one of the most successful opening batsmen in limited-overs
      cricket.
    </pr>
    <p>
      Rohit holds several remarkable records, including being the only cricketer
      to score three double centuries in ODIs and holding the world record for
      the highest individual ODI score of 264. Known for his elegant stroke play
      and ability to hit big sixes effortlessly, he is widely regarded as one of
      the best limited-overs batsmen of all time. Under his leadership, India
      achieved significant success, including the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup
      victory.
